To Enable Default Lua Console:
- `Right Ctrl` + `Right Shift` + `~` (Tilde)

### Default Launch Args
*With courtesy of [DoW-Mod-Manager](https://github.com/Fragjacker/DoW-Mod-Manager)*
- **-dev** : Starts the game in developers mode that provides helpful debug tools and enables execution of scripts (such as the autoexec.lua) in skirmish games, which are not available in the base game.
(WARNING: Don't use this in multiplayer as it will not work.)

- **-nomovies** : Skips all movies and directly launches the game with the loading screen for a faster startup (Is checked by default for convenience)

- **-forcehighpoly** : This option forces the game to display the higher resolution LOD of a Model at any given distance. (Hint : This may have a negative impact on your performance, use with caution.)

- **/high /affinity 6** : This option sets your Daw of War game executable priority to "High" and set it's affinity (CPU thread usage) to utilize only threads 2 and 3. In theory it could help to improve performance. It WILL NOT work if you have less than 3 CPU cores!

- **Disable Fog** : This option removes the brownish ambient fog from any map. This fog is particularly visible when zooming out really far or move the camera in a horizontal position, obstructing long distance view.
